### Project Description
Our project, Chaya_kada, is an immersive AI role-playing experience. Users interact with an AI "Chettan" (shopkeeper) in a mystical Kerala based interdimensional tea shop, ordering digital "chaya" and snacks while uncovering the lore of its interdimensional patrons. The entire experience is a dynamic conversation that builds a unique story with every interaction.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's frictionless digital world, we are tragically deprived of life's most character-building experiences: the warmth of a freshly-brewed tea, the wisdom of a cynical shopkeeper, and the gentle, ever-present anxiety of an accumulating, unpaid tab. We have solved for efficiency but have lost the art of a pointless, meandering conversation that ends with a debt you'll "settle tomorrow".

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Chaya_kada reintroduces this vital human experience. Our AI Chettan not only serves you digital tea and tells you stories about his mythical clientele, but he also meticulously tracks your debt in a nonsensical currency (Cosmic Rupees). The application provides no real value, cannot be won, and its primary goal is to entertain you with witty dialogue while your meaningless debt spirals into the cosmos.

*This use case diagram illustrates the workflow of the Chaya Kada website. The Customer interacts with various features such as conversing with ‚ÄúChettan‚Äù, eavesdropping on patrons, requesting the bill, checking the "Patt" book, and ordering snacks. Most of these interactions internally include the Generate AI Response process, which formats prompts and sends them to the external Gemini API for processing. The AI-generated responses drive the conversational and interactive experiences of the site.*
